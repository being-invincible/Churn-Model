# Churn-Model
 Churn is defined in business terms as 'when a client cancels a subscription to a service'. Here we will build a churn model from a customer churn dataset to predict which customer is most likely to leave.

The data has been provided in 'churn_data.csv' and the jupyter notebook will guide anyone on how to use tensorfow neural networks to train & predict outcomes from the developed model.
